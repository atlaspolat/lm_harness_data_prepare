The question is: who will reach the other side of the pool first?\n\nThe answer is Levent.\n\nLevent will reach the other side of the pool first because he is swimming at a faster speed than Mert. Levent is swimming at a speed of 3v, while Mert is swimming at a speed of 2v. This means that Levent will travel 3 meters for every 2 meters that Mert travels. Therefore, Levent will reach the other side of the pool in less time than Mert.\n\nSarp will not reach the other side of the pool first because he is not swimming. He is running along the side of the pool. Therefore, he will not be able to reach the other side of the pool until he gets in the water and starts swimming.",

The inequality is asking us to compare the values of the expressions \"TYT\" and \"AYT\". We can do this by substituting different values for the variables \"T\" and \"Y\".\n\nFor example, if we substitute the value 1 for the variable \"T\", and the value 2 for the variable \"Y\", then the expression \"TYT\" becomes 2, and the expression \"AYT\" becomes 4.

We can do this by dividing both sides of the inequality by \"Y\".\n\nThis gives us the following inequality:\n\n```\nT < A\n```\n\nWe can now solve this inequality for the variable \"T\" by multiplying both sides of the inequality by \"Y\".\n\nThis gives us the following solution:\n\n```\nT < AY\n```\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is \"T < AY\".",

The question is to solve the quadratic equation 9x^2 - 8x + 14 = 0.\n\nThe equation can be solved by using the quadratic formula:\n\n```\nx = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n```\n\nIn this case, a = 9, b = -8, and c = 14. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n```\nx = (-(-8) ± sqrt((-8)^2 - 4(9)(14))) / 2(9)\n```\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n```\nx = (8 ± sqrt(64 - 504)) / 18\n```\n\nFurther simplifying, we get:\n\n```\nx = (8 ± sqrt(-440)) / 18\n```\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is \"no real solutions\".\n\nIn LaTeX, the equation is written as:\n\n```\n9x^2 - 8x + 14 = 0\n```\n\nIn ASCII, the equation is written as:\n\n```\n9x^2 - 8x + 14 = 0\n```",

The question is to find the value of a and b, given the function f(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + ax + b.\n\nThe function f(x) is a cubic function. It has a graph that is a curve. The curve has a minimum at x = -3. The value of f(x) at the minimum is -27.\n\nThe function f(x) also has two inflection points. The inflection points are at x = -1 and x = 3. The value of f(x) at the inflection points is 27.\n\nWe can use the information about the minimum and the inflection points to find the values of a and b.\n\nFirst, we can use the minimum to find the value of b. We know that the minimum is at x = -3 and the value of f(x) at the minimum is -27. So, we can substitute these values into the equation f(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + ax + b to get:\n\n-27 = (-3)^3 + 9(-3)^2 + a(-3) + b\n\nWe can simplify this equation to get:\n\n-27 = -27 + 81 - 3a + b\n\nWe can then solve this equation for b to get:\n\nb = 27\n\nNow that we know the value of b, we can use the inflection points to find the value of a. We know that the inflection points are at x = -1 and x = 3 and the value of f(x) at the inflection points is 27. So, we can substitute these values into the equation f(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + ax + b to get:\n\n27 = (-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 + a(-1) + 27\n\nWe can simplify this equation to get:\n\n27 = -1 + 9 - a + 27\n\nWe can then solve this equation for a to get:\n\na = -27\n\nSo, the values of a and b are a = -27 and b = 27.",
